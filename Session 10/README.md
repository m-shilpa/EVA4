Assignment: 

Pick your last code
Make sure  to Add CutOut to your code. It should come from your transformations (albumentations)
Use this repo: https://github.com/davidtvs/pytorch-lr-finder (Links to an external site.) 
Move LR Finder code to your modules
Implement LR Finder (for SGD, not for ADAM)
Implement ReduceLROnPlatea: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau (Links to an external site.)
Find best LR to train your model
Use SDG with Momentum
Train for 50 Epochs. 
Show Training and Test Accuracy curves
Target 88% Accuracy.
Run GradCAM on the any 25 misclassified images. Make sure you mention what is the prediction and what was the ground truth label.
